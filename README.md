# Galaxies: Parzi's Star Wars Mod

In 2015, Parzi's Star Wars Mod was launched as a cooperative effort to bring together my favorite cinematic and digital worlds. Working alongside the community, we brought to life some of the in-depth and complex systems ever implemented in a Minecraft mod, and supported over a million players worldwide.

Today, I'm working again to create the **next generation** of mods which push the limit of the immersion possible within Minecraft, essentially using it as a game engine. This starts with Galaxies: Parzi's Star Wars Mod, which is slated to have **dozens of planets, locations, and landmarks** to explore, **hundreds of NPCs** to interact with, and **more quests** than you can count.

You can join the community in [the Discord server](https://discord.gg/54MVQZZ).
