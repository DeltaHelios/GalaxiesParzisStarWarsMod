# 0.0.1
Changelog:
* Added the Tatooine dimension (`/cdim 2`)
* Added a placeholder sky renderer for Tatooine
* Added an arbitrary structure near spawn on Tatooine to test the new "inline structure" system
* Added the Naboo dimension (`/cdim 3`)
* Added the T-65 X-Wing starfighter. (`/ship xwing`) Note: There is a forward and rear seat, one located near the cockpit and one located near the droid socket. Press F3 and you'll be able to see them. There are significant issues with the syncing between seats and ships, so if it stops working, kill the ship and spawn another one. See your controls menu for controls.
* Added the E-11 blaster rifle. Note: Left click to fire, right click to aim down sights (ADS). ADS is always accurate. As a debugging measure, you have 25 rounds. sneak-right click to reload. The rifle can be found in your Combat tab in creative.
